<ul>
<li><strong>New rig</strong> - My windows laptop died the other year so I needed a replacement to satisfy my gaming needs. I got myself a new box with medium tier parts.</li>
<li><strong>Learned Django</strong> - Finally learned Django after years of programming in Python. My first project was <a href="https://python.ph/jobs/">this job board</a>.</li>
<li><strong>New Insync office</strong> - Insync moved to a house in Xavierville Ave, Loyola Heights. QC represent!</li>
<li><strong>Baked without mixes</strong> - Not by myself but helped throughout the process. And it was really good!</li>
<li><strong>Taught Django</strong> - Got to teach basic Django in one of DevCon’s <a href="http://devcon.ph/events/python-code-camp-professionals">code camps</a>. I presented the process of creating a <a href="https://github.com/marksteve/devcon-django-workshop">Tinder clone</a> (what? it was hip then) using Django. I also mentored in the first <a href="https://djangogirls.org/manila/">Django Girls Manila workshop</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Surfed</strong> - Got to try out surfing in Baler. That proved useful when we went to Siargao later in the year.</li>
<li><strong>Attended my first non-relative wedding</strong> - Not really an achievement but I wanted to add it to the list. Congrats <a href="https://tonandana.com/">Ton and Ana</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Koh Phangan</strong> - Let’s mix in some travel. Koh Phangan is as beautiful as it was when I first saw it a few years ago. There were a lot more commercial establishments though.</li>
<li><strong>Started sport climbing</strong> - I got better than I was back in P.E. Still not good enough to be considered “good at it”. Outdoors was really fun! A lot scarier but the view is way more gorgeous.</li>
<li><strong>Helped organize PyCon PH</strong> - It’s my third time helping out. Good people makes it easy to volunteer.</li>
<li><strong>New job</strong> - Not technically a new job but I left <a href="https://insynchq.com">Insync</a> to focus on a <a href="https://blankhq.com">startup</a> I’ve co-founded. It’s one of the biggest decisions I made this year.</li>
<li><strong>Siargao</strong> - Best adventure of my entire life so far. Waves, motorbikes and appreciating nature’s beauty and scale. Best birthday ever!</li>
<li><strong>Gave a keynote talk</strong> - DevCon gave me the chance to do a keynote talk at their <a href="http://summit.devcon.ph/">annual conference</a>. I admittedly didn’t deliver a “keynote” talk but watching the good speakers throughout the event made me want to really improve.</li>
<li><strong>Sydney</strong> - One of the most pleasant places I’ve been to and it couldn’t have been better with the good friends I was with.</li>
</ul>
