  <p>I remembered this morning how <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> now supports
Docker with their latest default kernel. OC-ness urges kicked in so I decided
to replace the custom kernel I was using with the new <code>3.12.6</code> one. Soon after
I rebooted my vm, I ssh’d back to it and ran <code>docker ps</code>. My mouth was wide
open as I stared at an empty list. Even <code>docker images</code> was displaying
nothing. Docker somehow broke after I switched to the new kernel. But wait, I
had backup! I previously did a <code>docker export</code> on my <code>ghost-mysql</code> container
so it should be fine. First I cleared out <code>/var/lib/docker</code> and re-installed
docker. Then, I ran <code>docker import</code> and checked its filesystem. Nope.
<code>/var/lib/mysql/ghost</code> wasn’t there. I headed to <code>#docker</code> looking for answers
and some good soul told me about how volumes are exempted from the container’s
filesystem when exported. He also gave me a tip: link the volume to the
container and tar it up. Which kinda looks like this if you do it from the
docker cli:</p>
<pre class="microlight"><code>#!/bin/bash
sudo docker run -rm -i -volumes-from ghost-mysql ubuntu tar -cz /var/lib/mysql &gt; ~/backups/ghost-mysql-`date +%s`.tgz
</code></pre>
<p>Good thing I suck at blogging and only have three measly posts. Also,
<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> was kind enough to cache my pages so
it was easy to bring them back up again. And now I know how to properly backup
my container volumes. All’s well that ends well.</p>
